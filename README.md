===========

This is the Git repo for the BASIC robot code written for the in-class 
assignments in Abanulo's ES100 (Intro to Engineering Design).

What the Heck is Git?
---------------------

Git is version-control software. It gives people working on a group project
involving code a way to keep one version of the code available to 
everybody in the project at all times, instead of everyone having separate
versions that have to be kept up-to-date and maintained.

To learn more about Git, read the [Git docs](http://git-scm.com).

How to Get the Code
-------------------

To get the code on your computer, [install Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
and then run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/robojamison/basicrobot.git basicrobot
```

Or if you're using SSH, run this command:

```
git clone git@github.com:robojamison/basicrobot.git
```
